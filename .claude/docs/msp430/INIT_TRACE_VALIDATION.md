# MSP430 Initialization-Trace Validation (transport bring-up)

> **Purpose:** collect Glossy's own **startup TRACE** dumps across every
> target + transport, to validate the **SBW** and (later) **JTAG** transport
> layers end-to-end. Each entry is a known-good (or known-bad) capture of the
> `Starting JTAG → identify → profile select → GDB reader loop` sequence.

This is the companion to [`../project/MSP430_WIRING_GUIDE.md`](../project/MSP430_WIRING_GUIDE.md):
the wiring guide says *how to connect* a board; this doc records *that the
connection works* (which MCU it resolves to, on which transport).

## How to contribute a dump

1. Drop the raw startup TRACE under `supp/docs-ai/` (one file per case — name it
   per board/transport, e.g. `f5418a-sbw-init.txt`, so dumps don't clobber each
   other; `startup.txt` was the first).
2. Tell me the **probe** (BluePill-G431 / STLinkV2 / …) and the **transport**
   (SBW or JTAG) — the TRACE itself prints "Starting JTAG / JTAG identify path"
   for *both* transports and never names the probe, so those two facts must be
   tagged by hand.
3. I parse it into the matrix + an entry below.

## What the TRACE exposes (field key)

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `jtag_id` | TAP identifier — `0x91` = CPUXv2, `0x89` = CPUX, `0x..` legacy |
| `coreip_id` | Xv2 core IP block id |
| `device_id` / `id_data_addr` | Xv2 reads the real ID from the TLV at `id_data_addr` (usually `0x1a00`), not from `device_id` |
| `raw[0..3]` | the 4-word device signature read from `id_data_addr` → drives profile selection |
| profile flags | `[CPUXv2]`, `[EMEX_*]`, `[SLAUxxx]`, breakpoint count |

## Validation matrix

| MCU | Family / SLAU | Probe | Transport | jtag_id | coreip_id | raw signature | HW bkpts | Result | Dump |
|-----|---------------|:-----:|:---------:|:-------:|:---------:|---------------|:--------:|--------|------|
| MSP430F5418A | CPUXv2 / SLAU208 | ⚠ confirm | ⚠ SBW? | `0x91` | `0x0103` | `0606 2929 8000 1515` | 8 | ✅ identify + GDB loop | `supp/docs-ai/startup.txt` |

## Entries

### MSP430F5418A — SLAU208 (F5418 proto-board)

- **Probe / transport:** ⚠ to confirm (likely SBW — first bring-up case).
- **Result:** ✅ clean — TAP identified, profile resolved, GDB reader loop entered, no errors.
- **Dump:** `supp/docs-ai/startup.txt`

```
jtag_id     0x91          → CPUXv2
coreip_id   0x0103
device_id   0x0000        (Xv2: real ID comes from the TLV, not this field)
id_data_addr 0x1a00
raw[0..3]   0606 2929 8000 1515
profile     MSP430F5418A [CPUXv2] [EMEX_LARGE_5XX] [SLAU208] [1377]
HW bkpts    8
