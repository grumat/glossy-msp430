# `.claude/docs/` Index

Living working notes for this project. Treat each file as a refinable
draft, not a deliverable doc — update in place rather than starting
parallel files on the same topic. Repo root stays clean of markdown
besides `CLAUDE.md` and `CODE_GUIDELINES.md`.

## Layout

When adding a doc, pick the closest category. Create a new category
folder only when nothing fits and the topic is broad enough to grow.
Always add an entry to the appropriate section of this index, with a
one-line hook so future-you (or future-Claude) can locate it.

## bmt/

- [BMT_RCC_ENABLER_DESIGN](bmt/BMT_RCC_ENABLER_DESIGN.md) — single-source-of-truth peripheral clock/reset enabler design
- [GPIO_F1XX_IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW](bmt/GPIO_F1XX_IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW.md) — F1 GPIO bmt review
- [GPIO_F1XX_VS_G4XX_COMPARISON](bmt/GPIO_F1XX_VS_G4XX_COMPARISON.md) — cross-family GPIO API comparison
- [GPIO_G4XX_MISSING_FEATURES](bmt/GPIO_G4XX_MISSING_FEATURES.md) — gap list on the G4 port
- [TIMER_F1XX_IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW](bmt/TIMER_F1XX_IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW.md) — F1 Timer bmt review

## drivers/

- [DTRIG_JTAG_DRIVER](drivers/DTRIG_JTAG_DRIVER.md) — Double-Trigger SPI+TIM1 driver design (the only supported transport variant)
- [TIM_SBW_DRIVER](drivers/TIM_SBW_DRIVER.md) — design plan for the SBW counterpart: TIM1_CH1N clock on PB13, BSRR+CRx DMA on PB14, sovereign-Init resource model (draft; skeleton in `Firmware.shared/util/TimSbw.h`)
- [SBW_ISSUES](drivers/SBW_ISSUES.md) — draft GitHub issue bodies for the SBW bring-up: epic + 5 sub-issues (SbwDev skeleton, TimSbw encoder, direction turnaround, TapMcu arbitration, bench validation)
- [DTRIG_SBW_SPI_ALT](drivers/DTRIG_SBW_SPI_ALT.md) — parked alternate: encode SBW as a 3×-clocked SPI stream with SBWO on a TIM channel, reusing the DtrigJtag template almost verbatim (buffered boards only; post-MVP)
- [SPI_VARIANT_REMOVED](drivers/SPI_VARIANT_REMOVED.md) — why `JtagDev.spi.cpp` was retired in favour of dtrig (TMS edge-alignment limit) + last-working git refs
- [TIM_VARIANT_REMOVED](drivers/TIM_VARIANT_REMOVED.md) — why `JtagDev.tim.cpp` (TIM_DMA / TIM_DMA_SLOW) was retired + last-working git refs
- [TIM_DMA_TIMING_PROBE](drivers/TIM_DMA_TIMING_PROBE.md) — `OPT_TEST_TIM_DMA_TIMING` bench mode: driver-decoupled 100-pulse generator (TimSbw timer+DMA model, no TimSbw include) that measures the compare→DMA→BSRR latency on a logic analyzer per MCU; firmware `util/TimDmaTiming.h` + host `tools/tim_dma_timing.py`
- [SBW_SPEED_TIMING_MODEL](drivers/SBW_SPEED_TIMING_MODEL.md) — why SBW caps at ~1.3–1.4 MHz (DMA latency in TimSbw, not board RC): applies the measured `L=180 ns`/45 ns-jitter to a per-cycle timing model; frequency-compensated CCR table for 2/1/0.5/0.3 MHz; single-pin (2-DMA write serialization) can't reach 2 MHz, folded/buffered can — marginally; flags `T_settle` as the unmeasured read-side term

## msp430/

- [BREAKPOINTS_ANALYSIS](msp430/BREAKPOINTS_ANALYSIS.md) — breakpoint capability map across MSP430 families
- [MSP430_BREAKPOINT_WORKFLOW](msp430/MSP430_BREAKPOINT_WORKFLOW.md) — runtime workflow (insert/remove, EEM units)
- [MSP430_JTAG_SBW_IMPLEMENTATION](msp430/MSP430_JTAG_SBW_IMPLEMENTATION.md) — JTAG / Spy-Bi-Wire low-level protocol
- [SBW_PIN_ROLES_AND_FUSE](msp430/SBW_PIN_ROLES_AND_FUSE.md) — connector-level pin-role multiplexing: TEST/SBWTCK + ~RST/SBWDIO dual functions, signal naming (J…/T… prefixes), why fuse-burn needs 3 pins + 330 Ω, 2-wire LaunchPad vs TI; Glossy STLinkV2 PB13/PB14 mapping (entry must bit-bang the SBW pins, not JTAG-14 nRST/TEST)
- [SBW-AI](msp430/SBW-AI.md) — SBW notes
- [FR5994_SBW_GOLDEN_REFERENCE](msp430/FR5994_SBW_GOLDEN_REFERENCE.md) — known-good eZ-FET `MSP430_OpenDevice` SBW capture decoded to TAP-FSM + TCLK phase; function-boundary map vs our driver; kills the magic-pattern theory (#19/#20), pins the bug to `ReadWords` TCLK phasing + the 0x99 per-word-SetPC branch. Decoder: `supp/docs-ai/decode_sbw_fsm.py`
- [I2031_ACQUISITION_GOLDEN_REFERENCE](msp430/I2031_ACQUISITION_GOLDEN_REFERENCE.md) — corrected #43 reference (supersedes the old JTAG-only doc). The i20xx "password" is the **BSL Entry Sequence** (RST/TEST pulse train halting the CPU to LPM4) + **500 ms** settle + a `SPYBIWIREJTAG`/SBW open (TEST-pin activation), then jtag_id `0x89`. Confirmed by `MSP430_Configure(INTERFACE_MODE,…)`: plain `JTAG_IF` fails, `SPYBIWIREJTAG_IF`/`SPYBIWIRE_IF` work. glossy lacks the BSL preamble (the `slow_settle` tweak was wrong, reverted). Decoder: `supp/docs-ai/decode_jtag_fsm.py`
- [INIT_TRACE_VALIDATION](msp430/INIT_TRACE_VALIDATION.md) — collection of Glossy's own startup TRACE dumps per target+transport (validation matrix: jtag_id / raw signature / profile / HW bkpts) to validate the SBW and JTAG transport layers; companion to the wiring guide. Seeded with MSP430F5418A (STLinkV2/SBW); raw dumps tracked in `msp430/INIT_TRACE_VALIDATION/` (naming: `<mcu>_<transport>_<probe>_<kind>.txt`)
- [MEMORY_ACCESS_ALGORITHM_AUDIT](msp430/MEMORY_ACCESS_ALGORITHM_AUDIT.md) — #51 reviewed plan: per-region (Periph8/16, RAM, BSL, Info, Main) × per-SLAU-family bus-width/quick-read/quick-write capability audit, non-FRAM. 3 concrete code gaps found (no `WriteByte`, ROM writes not denied, `SlauName` display bug) + why the F1611 DataQuick failure is likely a silicon/family capability question, not a code bug + per-family sub-issue plan
- **Wiki cross-ref:** EEM register map / undocumented emulation registers (incl. `ETKEYSEL`/`ETCLKSEL` per-module clock control, reverse-engineered from UIF source) live in the `glossy-msp430.wiki` repo: `The-Missing-EEM-Documentation.md`. Referenced from [MSP430_BREAKPOINT_WORKFLOW](msp430/MSP430_BREAKPOINT_WORKFLOW.md) §3.3.
